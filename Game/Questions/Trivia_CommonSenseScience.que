Dummy -- The temperature falls. --
Dummy -- The temperature remains constant. --
Dummy -- Depends on the humidity in the room. --

You throw a bowling ball and a tennis ball in the air. The bowling ball only goes up 2 feet in the air, while the tennis ball goes up 10 feet. Assuming no air resistance, which object has the greatest acceleration while in the air? -- Bowling Ball -- since it will be closer to the center of the earth $$

A stone is thrown from a boat into the lake. What happens to the water level and why? -- Drops. In the boat, it displaces water of its own weight and when in water, it displaces water of its own volume. Since density of rock greater than water, volume displaced by weight is greater. --
Dummy -- Rises. In the boat, it displaces water of its own weight and when in water, it displaces water of its own volume. Since density of rock greater than water, volume displaced by weight is greater. --
Dummy -- Stays the same. In the boat, it displaces water of its own weight and when in water, it displaces water of its own volume. Since density of rock greater than water, volume displaced by weight is greater. --
Dummy -- Drops. There is less weight in the boat and therefore the boats rises. --
Dummy -- Stays the same. The rock being in the boat acts to sink the boat. The rock being in the lake acts to rise the water level. In effect they cancel one another. --

Why can't we image an atom with an optical microscope (best answer)? -- Need very high energy photons to be able to resolve the atom but these high energies are such that they will interact with the atom. --
Dummy -- Atoms will interact with the atom. --
Dummy -- Can't achieve the high photon energies require to be able to resolve the atom. --
Dummy -- Atoms will absorb the photons. --
Dummy -- Atoms are transparent to the photons. --

A Quooker should typically save money since: -- You only use the required amount of water. --
Dummy -- Although the temperature is maintain the cistern is very well insulated. --
Dummy -- It does not have to heat from colde every time boiling water is needed. --
Dummy -- All of these options. --
Dummy -- None of these options. --

If you bend over on mechanical scales what should the effect be? -- Tiny increase to weight -- closer to centre of earth $$
Dummy -- Large increase to weight. --
Dummy -- No change to weight. --

Two balls hanging from strings are close together but not touching. Air is blasted between them, what happens? -- Come together -- pressure $$
Dummy -- Move apart --
Dummy -- Nothing --
Dummy -- Oscillate --
Dummy -- None of these options. --

Neutrinos are not deflected by other particles in our body and pass through us. Why then are photons deflected? -- Light rays are a combination of oscillating electric and magnetic fields, and both fields interact strongly with charged particles. By contrast a neutrino only interacts via the weak force. --
Dummy -- They have charge. --
Dummy -- They have mass. --
Dummy -- All of these options. --
Dummy -- None of these options. --

How can you light a LED bulb with a AA battery and a single wire? -- Impossible since bulb requires 230V. --
How can you light a single base contact filament bulb with a AA battery and a single wire? -- Put one terminal of the battery to the rim of the bulb and the wire to the terminal. --
Dummy -- Wire from the positive terminal of the battery to the contact. --
Dummy -- Wire from the negative terminal of the battery to the contact. --
Dummy -- None of these options. --

Why does a dog pant and a lizard keep its mouth open? -- Lose heat through latent heat of vaporization. --
Dummy -- Lose heat through latent heat of condensation. --
Dummy -- Gain heat through latent heat of condensation. --
Dummy -- Gain heat through latent heat of vaporization. --
Dummy -- None of these options. --

A stunt plane goes into a vertical climb with high velocity and with full throttle. What is the most likely reason it comes to a stop? -- Force of gravity is greater than engine force. --
Dummy -- Engine force is greater than force of gravity. --
Dummy -- Engine stalls. --
Dummy -- Throttle released. --
Dummy -- None of these options. --

Best reason for tread wearing much faster on front two tyres of a car? -- Mass of engine means greater mass on the front two tyres. Also front wheel drive. --
Dummy -- Mass of engine means greater mass on the front two tyres. --
Dummy -- Front wheel drive. --
Dummy -- Cheaper tyres. --
Dummy -- None of these options. --

Which is has the greatest longitudinal bending resistance and why: a solid cyclinder or hollow cyclinder, both uniform and equal in length? -- Hollow. Greater moment of inertia. --
Dummy -- Hollow. Smaller moment of inertia. --
Dummy -- Solid. Greater moment of inertia. --
Dummy -- Solid. Smaller moment of inertia. --
Dummy -- Both the same. --

Is there any significant advantage in painting radiators black, since back is a better emitter of IR? -- No, since a radiator mainly heats by conduction and the paint acts as insulator. --
Dummy -- No, since black also absorbs an equal amount of IR. --
Dummy -- Yes, since radiators mainly radiatively. --
Dummy -- Yes and the paint also acts as a heat sink. --
Dummy -- None of these options. --
